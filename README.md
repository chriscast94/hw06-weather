# hw06-weather

## Description

I wanted to create a site that provided an accurate forecast. You would be able to search for any city, and it would show you the temperature, wind speed, humidity percentage, and UV index, along with a five day forecast of the area. I would do this by utilizing the popular weather api, openweathermaps. 
It's currently displaying a simple method without too much functionality, however, the goal is to be able to have the site have an attractive presentation while it provides the weather.
